SEACAS System Overview<P>
<H1> Philosophy</H1>
<HR>
 SEACAS is a modular system based upon a common binary datafile format called EXODUS<A HREF="SEACAS_Overview.06_94_6.html#1"><EM>1</EM></A> which includes the mesh description and the timeplanes of the computed results. <P>
 A subset of this format, called GENESIS<A HREF="SEACAS_Overview.06_94_6.html#2"><EM>2</EM></A>, was a precursor to the EXODUS format. GENESIS is often used in references and reports to refer to the mesh description portion of the EXODUS format.<P>
 We are currently upgrading the original EXODUS file format. EXODUS now refers to a generic format. When it is important to differentiate, the older sequential database is called EXODUS I and the newer randomly accessible, platform independent database is known as EXODUS II3.<P>
 Some codes have not yet migrated to the EXODUS II file format. The scripts that control the codes will automatically translate the input files to the required format. so that all of the preprocessing, analysis, and postprocessing codes can read and/or write the EXODUS database files formats as required. A schematic of this is shown in Figure 1.<P>

<P>
 With this structure, codes can be tailored for a single function. For example, an analysis code can be added to the system without writing new mesh generation and post processing programs. Also, code to code data transfers and restarts use the EXODUS format. A more complete view of this is shown in <A HREF="#4">Figure 2</A>.<P>

<P>
 This modular concept is used extensively in the mesh generation process. Several special-purpose codes have been written that each perform a certain mesh generation task. Examples of this are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>generate two-dimensional mesh (fastq).<BR>
<P>
<LI>transform two-dimensional mesh into a three-dimensional mesh (gen3d, genshell).<BR>
<P>
<LI>join two or more 2D or 3D meshes into a single mesh (gjoin).<BR>
<P>
<LI>reposition a 2D or 3D mesh (grepos).<P>
</UL>
 This structure is shown in <A HREF="#5">Figure 3</A> on the following page. Finite element meshes of complicated three-dimensional geometries have been successfully generated using this system built up of codes that singly provide a limited capability, but when used as a system are very powerful.<P>

<P>
 All of the codes are written in as portable a form as possible. Fortran codes are written in ANSI Standard FORTRAN-77<A HREF="SEACAS_Overview.06_94_6.html#3"><EM>4</EM></A> and C language codes are written in ANSI Standard C<A HREF="SEACAS_Overview.06_94_6.html#4"><EM>5</EM></A> where possible. Machine-specific routines are limited in number and are grouped together to minimize the time required to adapt them to a new system. SEACAS codes have been ported to several Unix systems including Cray, HP, Sun, Dec, Stardent, Convex, IBM, and SGI.<P>
 A code management system called <CODE>CVS</CODE><A HREF="SEACAS_Overview.06_94_6.html#5"><EM>6</EM></A> is used for all of the SEACAS codes to provide traceability and retrievability for Quality Assurance. The change logs include who changed the code, when it was changed, what was changed, and why the change was made. If required, any previous version can be retrieved.<P>
