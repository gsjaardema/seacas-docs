<H3> Algebra</H3>
 The ALGEBRA program allows the user to manipulate data from a finite element analysis before it is plotted. The finite element output data is in the form of variable values (e.g., stress, strain, and velocity components) in an EXODUS database. The Algebra program evaluates user-supplied functions of the data and writes the results to an output EXODUS database which can be read by plot programs.<P>

<H3> Aprepro</H3>
 Aprepro is an algebraic preprocessor that reads a file containing both general text and algebraic, string, or conditional expressions. It interprets the expressions and outputs them to the output file along with the general text. The syntax used in Aprepro is such that all expressions between the delimiters <CODE>{</CODE> and <CODE>}</CODE> are evaluated and all other text is simply echoed to the output file. Aprepro contains several mathematical functions, string functions, and flow control constructs. In addition, functions are included that, with some additional files, implement a units conversion system and a material database lookup system. Aprepro was written primarily to simplify the preparation of parameterized input files for finite element analyses at Sandia National Laboratories; however, it can process any text file that does not use the characters <CODE>{ }</CODE>. <P>

<H3> Blot</H3>
 BLOT is a graphics program for post-processing of finite element analyses output in the EXODUS database format. It is command driven with free-format input and can drive any graphics device supported by the Sandia Virtual Device Interface.<P>
 BLOT produces mesh plots with various representations of the analysis output variables. The major mesh plot capabilities are deformed mesh plots, line contours, filled (painted) contours, vector plots of two/three variables (e.g., velocity vectors), and symbol plots of scalar variables (e.g., discrete cracks). Pathlines of analysis variables can also be drawn on the mesh. BLOT's features include element selection by material, element birth and death, multiple views for combining several displays on each plot, symmetry mirroring, and node and element numbering.<P>
 BLOT can also produce X-Y curve plots of the analysis variables. BLOT generates time-versus-variable plots or variable-versus-variable plots. It also generates distance-versus-variable plots at selected time steps where the distance is the accumulated distance between pairs of nodes or element centers. <P>

<H3> Cubit</H3>
 The CUBIT mesh generation environment is a two- and three-dimensional finite element mesh generation tool which is being developed to pursue the goal of robust and unattended mesh generation--effectively automating the generation of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. It is a solid-modeler based pre-processor that meshes volume and surface solid models for finite element analysis. A combination of techniques including paving, mapping, sweeping, and various other algorithms being developed are available for discretizing the geometry into a finite element mesh. CUBIT also features boundary layer meshing specifically designed for fluid flow problems. Boundary conditions can be applied to the mesh through the geometry and appropriate files for analysis generated. CUBIT is specifically designed to reduce the time required to create all-quadrilateral and allhexahedral meshes. The manual is designed to serve as a reference and guide to creating finite element models in the CUBIT environment.<P>

<H3> Exodus II File Format</H3>
 EXODUS II is a model developed to store and retrieve data for finite element analyses. It is used for preprocessing (problem definition), postprocessing (results visualization), as well as code to code data transfer. An EXODUS II data file is a random access, machine independent file written and read via C or Fortran library routines which comprise the Application Programming Interface (API). The Network Common Data Form (netCDF, (C) 1993 University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Unidata) was selected to handle the low-level data storage for the EXODUS II format.<P>

<H3> Fastq</H3>
 The FASTQ code is an interactive two-dimensional finite element mesh generation program. It is designed to provide a powerful and efficient tool to both reduce the time required of an analyst to generate a mesh, and to improve the capacity to generate good meshes in arbitrary geometries. It has a number of meshing techniques available: 1) paving for filling arbitrary volumes with elements of arbitrary size, 2) basic mapping techniques, 3) a set of higher-order primitives which have been developed for automatic meshing of commonly encountered shapes (i.e. the triangle, semi-circle, etc.) and conditions (i.e. mesh transitioning from coarse to fine mesh size) and 4) general mesh improvements through smoothing, element reconnection, etc. FASTQ has been designed to allow user flexibility and control. The user interface is built on a layered command level structure. Multiple utilities are provided for input, manipulation, and display of the geometric information, as well as for direct control, adjustment, and display of the generated mesh. Enhanced boundary flagging has been incorporated and multiple element types and output formats are supported. FASTQ includes adaptive meshing capabilities with error estimation, deformed and undeformed remeshing according to the error, element variable remapping, and some basic post-processing plotting.<P>

 This paper presents a new mesh generation technique, paving, which meshes arbitrary two-dimensional geometries with an all-quadrilateral mesh. Paving allows varying element size distributions on the boundary as well as the interior of a region. The generated mesh is well formed (i.e. nearly square elements, elements perpendicular to boundaries, etc.) and geometrically pleasing (i.e. mesh contours tend to follow geometric contours of the boundary). In this paper we describe the theory behind this algorithmic/heuristic technique, evaluate the performance of the approach and present examples of automatically generated meshes.<P>

<H3> Gen3D</H3>
 GEN3D is a three-dimensional mesh generation program. The three-dimensional mesh is generated by mapping a two-dimensional mesh into three-dimensions according to one of four types of transformations: translating, rotating, mapping onto a spherical surface, and mapping onto a cylindrical surface. The generated three-dimensional mesh can then be reoriented by offsetting, reflecting about an axis, and revolving about an axis. GEN3D can be used to mesh geometries that are axisymmetric or planar, but, due to three-dimensional loading or boundary conditions, require a three-dimensional finite element mesh and analysis. More importantly, it can be used to mesh complex three-dimensional geometries composed of several sections when the sections can be defined in terms of transformations of two-dimensional geometries. The code GJOIN is then used to join the separate sections into a single body. GEN3D reads and writes two-dimensional and three-dimensional mesh databases in the GENESIS database format; therefore, it is compatible with the preprocessing, postprocessing, and analysis codes used by the Engineering Analysis Department at Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM.<P>

<H3> Genshell</H3>
 GENSHELL is a three-dimensional shell mesh generation program. The three-dimensional shell mesh is generated by mapping a two-dimensional quadrilateral mesh into three dimensions according to one of several types of transformations: translation, mapping onto a spherical, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical surface, and mapping onto a user-defined spline surface. The generated three-dimensional mesh can then be reoriented by offsetting, reflecting about an axis, revolving about an axis, and scaling the coordinates. GENSHELL can be used to mesh complex three-dimensional geometries composed of several sections when the sections can be defined in terms of transformations of two-dimensional geometries. The code GJOIN is then used to join the separate sections into a single body. GENSHELL updates the EXODUS quality assurance and information records to help track the codes and files used to generate the mesh. GENSHELL reads and writes two-dimensional and three-dimensional mesh databases in the GENESIS database format; there, it is compatible with the preprocessing, postprocessing, and analysis codes in the Sandia National Laboratories Engineering Analysis Code Access System (SEACAS).<P>

<H3> Grepos</H3>
 GREPOS is a mesh utility program that repositions or modifies the configuration of a 2D or 3D mesh. Grepos can be used to change the orientation and size of a 2D or 3D mesh; change the material block, nodeset, and sideset IDs; or "explode" the mesh to facilitate viewing of the various parts of the model. Grepos also updates the EXODUS QA and information records to help track the codes and files used to generate the mesh. GREPOS reads and writes 2D and 3D mesh databases in the GENESIS database format; therefore, it is compatible with the preprocessing, postprocessing, and analysis codes in SEACAS.<P>

<H3> Pronto2D and Pronto3D</H3>
 PRONTO 2D is a two-dimensional transient solid dynamics code for analyzing large deformations of highly nonlinear materials subjected to extremely high strain rates. This Lagrangian finite element program uses an explicit time integration operator to integrate the equations of motion. Four node uniform strain quadrilateral elements are used in the finite element formulation. A number of new numerical algorithms which have been developed for the code are described in this report. An adaptive time step control algorithm is described which greatly improves stability as well as performance in plasticity problems. A robust hourglass control scheme which eliminates hourglass distortions without disturbing the finite element solution is included. All constitutive models in PRONTO are cast in an unrotated configuration defined using the rotation determined from the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient. An accurate incremental algorithm was developed to determine this rotation and is described in detail. A robust contact algorithm was developed which allows for the impact and interaction of deforming contact surfaces of quite general geometry. A number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the utility of these algorithms. <P>

 SANTOS is a finite element computer program designed to compute the quasistatic, large deformation, inelastic response of planar or axisymmetric solids. SANTOS is based on the dynamics program PRONTO2D by L. M. Taylor and D. P. Flanagan. SANTOS utilizes a self-adaptive dynamic relaxation algorithm to achieve a quasistatic solution. The efficiency, speed, through vectorization, and state-of-the-art algorithms that Taylor and Flanagan built into PRONTO2D are maintained in SANTOS. The architecture of the code as well as the user interface is similar for both codes which improves code reliability and encourages the use of both codes by analysts.
