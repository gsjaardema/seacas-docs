The \caps{\PROGRAM} program allows the user to manipulate data from a
finite element analysis before it is plotted. The finite element output
data is in the form of variable values (e.g., stress, strain, and
velocity components) in an EXODUS database. The \caps{\PROGRAM} program
evaluates user-supplied functions of the data and writes the results to
an output EXODUS database which can be read by plot programs.
