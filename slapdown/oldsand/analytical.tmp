Structural analyses of transportation casks are necessary to determine
their response to the hypothetical accident conditions of 10 CFR 71.
The accident conditions specify that the cask must survive a 30 foot
drop onto a rigid target at various orientations.  The event that
sometimes produces the highest loads in the cask is {\em slapdown}. 

{\em Slapdown} refers to the case in which the cask is dropped at a
nearly horizontal orientation such that the initial impact produces a
rotational velocity which causes a secondary impact at the opposite end
of the cask.  In some cases the cask impacts the secondary point at a
higher velocity than the initial vertical velocity of the cask. It is
prohibitively expensive to determine the maximum slapdown velocity from
a full three-dimensional structural code since the analyses must be run
at several different impact angles to determine the orientation that
results in the highest secondary impact velocity.
